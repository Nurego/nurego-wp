Nurego WordPress Plugin
=======================

This is a wordpress plugin for easy interaction with the Nurego API.
It can fetch offerings currently, and will soon be build out to do fetch
plans uniquely available to certain customers/segments, accept parameters
for style and placement, and other misc functionality that comes to mind.

It renders a basic html table so it is most likely compatible with your current
WordPress theme.


Usage
-----

    [nurego api_key='<YOUR API KEY>' set_params='param:value, param2:value2']
